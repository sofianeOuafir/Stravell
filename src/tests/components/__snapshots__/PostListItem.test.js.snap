That you should always keep your eyes and mind open to observe the world around you and all that it has to offer. \\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"df8pe\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"11lei\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"6ddvh\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"1jps5\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}}],\\"entityMap\\":{\\"0\\":{\\"type\\":\\"IMAGE\\",\\"mutability\\":\\"IMMUTABLE\\",\\"data\\":{\\"src\\":\\"https://stravell-production.s3.amazonaws.com/pictures/ea5f10a1-10c3-4cfd-a607-982678db7159/49014533_290589528468380_8550961320021721088_n.jpg\\",\\"alignment\\":\\"center\\",\\"width\\":65}}}}",
