The colours of Autum, the bright atmosphere of the attractions, the 'wow' factor of the falls and environment of the city itself. This trip made me come to the conclusion that even though you may have been to a place many times before, or even this may be a place that you call home, there will always be new things to discover. That you should always keep your eyes and mind open to observe the world around you and all that it has to offer. \\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"df8pe\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"11lei\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"6ddvh\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"1jps5\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}}],\\"entityMap\\":{\\"0\\":{\\"type\\":\\"IMAGE\\",\\"mutability\\":\\"IMMUTABLE\\",\\"data\\":{\\"src\\":\\"https://stravell-production.s3.amazonaws.com/pictures/ea5f10a1-10c3-4cfd-a607-982678db7159/49014533_290589528468380_8550961320021721088_n.jpg\\",\\"alignment\\":\\"center\\",\\"width\\":65}}}}",
