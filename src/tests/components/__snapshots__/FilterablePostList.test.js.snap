I am originally from Ontario, Canada and when meeting other travellers from around the world, they would always express how lucky I was to be from such a beautiful country. I always could agree, as I knew that many places all over Canada, some even I haven't been have beautfiul landscapes. What I always seem to forget, is how beautiful my home province of Ontario, truly is. Recently, a friend from another country had come to visit Canada and I choose to take him around Ontario where I could, to allow him to have a good expierence in Canada.  He arrived in October, so the weather was a bit cold, but the colours were gorgeous. We decided to take a trip to Niagara Falls, where we spent the weekend. I went to school in Niagara Falls, so I have been there many times before, not expecting much from the trip. \\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"728k6\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"79oud\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"3k8rc\\",\\"text\\":\\" \\",\\"type\\":\\"atomic\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[{\\"offset\\":0,\\"length\\":1,\\"key\\":0}],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"a3mbg\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"7u5rt\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"eu0ae\\",\\"text\\":\\"It turned out, I was in for a treat. Even though I had seen this place many times before, my travelling partner had really allowed me to see the beauty that I never took in before. As I watched him expierence everything for the first time, making comments on things he was observing, I realised I was observing these things through brand new eyes. The colours of Autum, the bright atmosphere of the attractions, the 'wow' factor of the falls and environment of the city itself. This trip made me come to the conclusion that even though you may have been to a place many times before, or even this may be a place that you call home, there will always be new things to discover. That you should always keep your eyes and mind open to observe the world around you and all that it has to offer. \\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"df8pe\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"11lei\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"6ddvh\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}},{\\"key\\":\\"1jps5\\",\\"text\\":\\"\\",\\"type\\":\\"unstyled\\",\\"depth\\":0,\\"inlineStyleRanges\\":[],\\"entityRanges\\":[],\\"data\\":{}}],\\"entityMap\\":{\\"0\\":{\\"type\\":\\"IMAGE\\",\\"mutability\\":\\"IMMUTABLE\\",\\"data\\":{\\"src\\":\\"https://stravell-production.s3.amazonaws.com/pictures/ea5f10a1-10c3-4cfd-a607-982678db7159/49014533_290589528468380_8550961320021721088_n.jpg\\",\\"alignment\\":\\"center\\",\\"width\\":65}}}}",
